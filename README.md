# clicky-game

## How it works
* The user begins the game by clicking on a Character GIF
* After each click, React will shuffle the cards using an NPM package called Shuffle-Array and check if the user has selected theGIF before
* If they have, it will trigger an end game condition
* If they have not, it will increase the current score
* Upon game end, the app will update your highest score and reset the current score

## Technologies used
* React JS
